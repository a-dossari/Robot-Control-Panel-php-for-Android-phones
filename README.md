# Create robot control panel application connected to a database.

I created a web page in PHP format containing a control panel (controller) for the robot, then I connected the web page to a database. After that, I created a mobile application linked to the web page to control the robot using the phone.

As you can see in the file, there are options to control the movement of the robot, which are: forward, backward, right, left, and stop.
